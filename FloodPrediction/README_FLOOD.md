 Kerala is a city in India which is very prone to flood due to the fact that it is sorrounded by Arabian sea with high rain index.
 The dataset was gotten from kaggle
 The aim of the project is to test my data analysis knowledge , which includes, loading data, 
 data cleaning, data visualization and insight. And also to test my Machine learning knowledge in Algorithm usage, feature (selection and engineering)&
 metrics evaluation

### * Requirements
 IDE - Jupyter notebook or Anaconda

Python Packages and liberaries installation
 *	 seaborn
 *	 pandas
 *   matplotlib
 *	numpy
 
# Why do i need this liberaries
